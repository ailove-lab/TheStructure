■ vs ▲ and ●

WHAT YOU DO HERE

1. Born
2. Grow
3. Die

MAIN THINGS:

0. THE SPACE
   The Space contain every thing  and has it own laws
   The Space has multiple planes, transfer from plane to plane - costs energy
   The Space contains the structures of various forms mainly ■ & ▲, but another to
   The Plane of born calculated by carmic weight  
1. THE ENERGY + compact form [E]
   Energy spread in the space and can be absorbed with an EA
2. THE STRUCTURES / square / triangle [S]
   Main non compatible structures
   Part of a structure floating in the space can be absorbed by EA
   ■ absorbs ▲ vith x2 value and vice versa, so this things will be natural enemies
3. THE AUTOMATS ■ & ▲ [A]
   Semi live beings which creating the structures and TOOLS

PLANES

NIRVANA -> SANSARA -> HELL

Look for names from vedic and texts,

- 0 -

   NIRVANA
   Personal void level for every human created structure
   there nothing you can to do, only see flowing of things

- 1 -
    
   SPIRIT PLANE
   Spirit level conains friendly beings
   You can assist or be assisted on this plan by friendly beings
   On this plane you can form/plan your feature structure

- 2 - material
   
   SANSARA PLANES

- 3 - hyper material

   HELL PLANES


THE VOID

   Disasterous thing, destructing every thing material and emiting the energy to the space
   Apears during the structure colapse (EV hit)


TOOLS

4. Energy absorbers [EA#]
   a: Absorbs only energy (slow)
   b: Absorbs only the same type of structures and only small parts
   c: Distance and speed grow
   d: Can split huge structures to small parts
   e: Absorbs enemy structures to
5. Energy emmitters [EE#]
   a: distance
   b: power
   c: can launch self tracking missile
   d: can launch 
6. Motivators [M]
   Thing for moving whole structure in the space    
7. Energy vaults [EV]
   Storage for compact energy
8. Core ?


ASSEMBLING:

Assembling and disassembling things has no cost

ЕА + 100 time = 1E
EA + 1▲S = 2E
EA + 1■S = 1E
A + 4E = A + A
A + 9E = A + 1S
A + 8E = A + EA0 (Energy absorber level 0)
EA(N) + (N^2)E = EA(N+1) Exponential value grow

CONTROLS:

You can control the structure by setting a plan:
The Plan contains the structure creation tasks and tools on it
The Plan contains the structure moving instructions or behavior pattern.
